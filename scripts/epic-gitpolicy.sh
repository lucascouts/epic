# Contradiction lint for a workspace's .epic git policy (story 007, R4.1/R4.3).
#
# Usage: epic-gitpolicy.sh          measure the CURRENT DIRECTORY, print JSON
#        epic-gitpolicy.sh --help
#
# Output: one JSON object on stdout —
#   {git: true, policy: tracked-md|local-only|undeclared,
#    gitignore_ignores_epic: bool, gitignore_source: "<path>"|null,
#    tracked_md: N, tracked_draft: N,
#    verdict: consistent|contradiction|partial}
# and, in a workspace that is not a git repository:
#   {git: false, policy: …, verdict: "consistent"}                       (R4.3)
#
# CONSUMER REQUIREMENT — READ A MEASUREMENT KEY ONLY WHEN `git` IS true.
# `git`, `policy` and `verdict` are TOTAL: every path emits all three, so they
# are safe to read unconditionally. The four MEASUREMENT keys are not —
# gitignore_ignores_epic, gitignore_source, tracked_md and tracked_draft are
# ABSENT from the non-git object, and `jq -r` renders an absent key as the
# literal text `null`, not as `false`, `""` or `0`. So the obvious
#   [[ "$(jq -r .tracked_md "$j")" -gt 0 ]]
# does NOT read false there: `-gt` evaluates its operands as arithmetic, bash
# takes the bare word `null` for a variable name, and under `set -u` the
# consumer ABORTS with "null: unbound variable" (measured, bash 5.3).
# Gate every measurement read on `git == true`, or equivalently on
# `verdict != "consistent"` — the non-git object always reports `consistent`,
# so that gate is what keeps today's consumers safe. It is an invariant of this
# script, not of the JSON: state the gate in the consumer, do not infer it.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every measurement path, including "not a git repository" — a workspace
#      this cannot measure is not an error, it is a workspace with nothing to
#      say (R4.3)
#   2  usage error only (an argument this script does not take)
#
# WHY IT EXISTS: kpranois committed 47 .epic files THROUGH a .gitignore that
# said they were never committed; bentoolkit flip-flopped its policy five times
# and left zombie artifacts behind. Neither workspace was broken in any way git
# would ever mention — both were merely self-contradictory. This is the one
# place that says so, in one line, from five measured facts.
#
# Governing principle: READ-ONLY. This script writes NO files and runs no git
# command that can mutate anything. Every git call has its non-zero status
# neutralised — `|| rc=$?` where the status is the answer, a process
# substitution where the OUTPUT is the answer (the shell never checks a
# procsub's status) — so an expected failure never trips `set -e`, and git
# stderr is silenced so the stdout JSON is the only thing consumers ever see
# (wave-0 convention, see scripts/story-git-status.sh).
#
# CONSUMERS read this with jq and nothing more: init pre-fills its question from
# `policy` + `gitignore_ignores_epic` and needs `gitignore_source` to know WHICH
# file to offer to edit, and the story list prints one header line when
# `verdict != consistent`. THAT SECOND CONSUMER IS WHY EVERY RULE BELOW IS
# WEIGHED FOR NOISE AND NOT ONLY FOR TRUTH: a verdict that fires on an ordinary
# healthy workspace fires on every single list. Where a rule had to choose, it
# chose silence, and the choice is argued at the rule.

# --- String quoting ---------------------------------------------------------
# `policy` and `verdict` are normalised to one of three literals and the counts
# are integers, so those are safe by construction. `gitignore_source` IS NOT:
# it is a filesystem path git hands us, so it carries whatever bytes the
# workspace (or the user's global core.excludesFile) happens to contain — the
# one externally-authored string in this document, and the reason the escaper
# is live rather than defensive. It is the FULL C0/C1 table rather than
# validate-story.sh's lighter \ " \n \r \t variant because a path may hold ANY
# byte but /, and a single unescaped control byte would make the WHOLE document
# unparseable while the script still exits 0 — an undefined consumer path,
# because exit 0 is the contract's promise that the JSON is readable. Measured:
# a repo under a directory whose name contains a newline yields the source
# `we<LF>ird/.gitignore`, which reaches the escaper raw. Copied from
# scripts/story-git-status.sh; see its comment for the locale argument and the
# C1 UTF-8 pairing.
#
# ONE-LINE DELTA WARNING, carried over with the copy: 8 and 12 MUST stay in the
# loop list below, because this file keeps only \ " \n \r \t as short forms and
# has no \b / \f. Copying archive-story.sh's list (which omits them) instead
# would leave 0x0C unescaped — exactly the bug the table exists to close.
JSON_ESC_RAW=()   # needle: the literal byte sequence to replace
JSON_ESC_REP=()   # replacement: its \uXXXX form
# `printf -v needle "$needle"` is a TWO-STAGE printf and the variable-as-format
# is the point: stage 1 builds the literal text `\x1b`, stage 2 makes printf
# interpret that escape into the byte itself. Writing the byte directly is not
# an option — it is what we are trying to produce.

# --- Is .epic ignored, and by what? -----------------------------------------
# THREE MEASURED FACTS DECIDE THIS CALL'S EXACT SHAPE, and each is easy to undo
# by accident (git 2.55, reproduced in the kpranois fixture):
#
#   1. `--no-index` IS MANDATORY. Without it `git check-ignore` refuses to
#      report a path the index already knows, so the ONE workspace this lint
#      exists for — files tracked THROUGH an ignoring .gitignore, `git add -f`
#      — answers "not ignored" and the contradiction disappears. Measured:
#      `check-ignore .epic` → rc 1, `check-ignore --no-index .epic` → rc 0
#      naming `.gitignore:1:.epic/`. The flag is the whole point of the probe.
#
#   2. THE PROBED PATH KEEPS ITS TRAILING SLASH. A directory-only pattern
#      (`.epic/`, `/.epic/`) matches the pathname `.epic/` always, but matches
#      the bare `.epic` only when the directory exists on disk — git stats the
#      filesystem to decide. Probing `.epic` would therefore go quiet in the
#      exact case init cares about: a workspace whose .epic/ has not been
#      created yet. `.epic/` matches under all three spellings the corpus
#      shows — `.epic`, `.epic/` and `/.epic/` — present or absent.
#
#   3. `-v -z --stdin` IS THE ONLY UNAMBIGUOUS WAY TO READ THE SOURCE, and the
#      three flags are one decision, not three. `-v` names the rule; its human
#      format is `<source>:<line>:<pattern>\t<pathname>`, from which `${x%%:*}`
#      recovers the source only while no source path contains a colon —
#      measured false for `we:ird/.gitignore`, and a global core.excludesFile
#      is an absolute path chosen by the user. Worse, plain `-v` C-QUOTES an
#      unusual name (a newline in a directory name comes back as the literal
#      text `"we\nird/.gitignore"`, surrounding quotes included), so the parsed
#      value would be wrong even where the split works. `-z` drops both the
#      quoting and the ambiguity, replacing every separator with NUL
#      and drops the quoting: `<source>\0<line>\0<pattern>\0<pathname>\0`, raw
#      bytes. And `-z` is refused without `--stdin` — measured, verbatim:
#      "fatal: -z only makes sense with --stdin" — which is why the path is fed
#      in rather than passed as an argument. Do not "simplify" any one of them
#      away.
#
# SCOPE, wider than "the root .gitignore" on purpose: check-ignore answers for
# every exclude source git consults — the root .gitignore, .git/info/exclude
# and the user's global core.excludesFile (all three verified to match here).
# A rule in any of them produces the identical kpranois shape, and asking git
# rather than parsing text also buys negations, `**` and precedence for free.
# The boolean is therefore named for what it means: git ignores .epic, whatever
# said so — and it stays that wide, because that is the predicate the
# contradiction verdict needs.
#
# WHY THE SOURCE IS REPORTED SEPARATELY: the boolean cannot answer the question
# init has to ask. Its ToDo is "root gitignore has an .epic rule → ask consent
# to remove it", and a bare `true` does not say WHERE the rule lives. A user
# whose GLOBAL excludesFile ignores .epic — a large population, since the house
# rule is "always gitignore .epic" — in a repo whose root .gitignore is
# innocent reads `true` with no line to remove; the wizard would offer a dead
# end or edit the wrong file. Measured, and distinguishable at no extra git
# call: root rule → `.gitignore`, repo-local rule → `.git/info/exclude`,
# nothing → no output at all.
#
# READ FROM THE FIRST NUL FIELD, NOT FROM THE EXIT STATUS, and let ONE test
# decide both keys. `$(…)` is not an option: command substitution DROPS NUL
# bytes and would splice the four fields into one word, so the answer has to be
# `read` from a process substitution — which discards the exit status the old
# `-q` form used. It loses nothing: git prints a record only for a MATCH, so
# "named a source" ⇔ rc 0. Measured on the shape that looks most like a
# counter-example — `.epic/` followed by `!.epic/` — git prints nothing and
# exits 1, the same as no rule at all.
#
# DO NOT ADD `--non-matching`. It is the one flag that would print a record for
# a path that is NOT ignored, with every field empty (`::<TAB>.epic/`), and the
# equivalence above is what couples the two keys — the `-n` conjunct below is
# the belt to that brace, so `gitignore_ignores_epic: true` beside
# `gitignore_source: null` stays unreachable whatever a later edit does.
#
# Both failure modes still fail toward silence: not ignored (rc 1) and git
# could not answer (rc 128) produce no output, hence `false` and `null`, and
# the header's noise argument is why that is the right default.

# counts and the "is anything left to add?" probe disagree about the same file,
# which is a verdict bug with no visible symptom. Predicates, not a function
# returning the class on stdout: a command substitution would fork once per
# tracked path, and this runs on every story list.

#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY EXCLUDES is as load-bearing as what it includes: the
# policy's own machinery, .epic/.gitpolicy and .epic/.gitignore, is an artifact
# of NO policy and is legitimately committed under EVERY one of them — a
# .gitpolicy nobody else can read declares nothing to a teammate, and the nested
# .gitignore is how .draft/ stays out of the index. Counting them would report a
# contradiction against the very file that declares the policy, on a local-only
# workspace that did nothing wrong. Every other non-artifact file under .epic/
# falls in the same gap for the same reason: only the artifact set can answer
# "is the declared policy real?".

# --- Tracked-file counts ----------------------------------------------------
# THE TWO COUNTS ARE DISJOINT AND MUST STAY THAT WAY. A .draft note is very
# often a .md file — .epic/stories/NNN-x/.draft/notes.md is the standard one —
# so "is it markdown?" and "is it a draft?" are not independent questions and
# cannot be asked in either order without a rule. The rule: ANY path with a
# /.draft/ component is a draft and nothing else, whatever its extension. The
# if/elif is what enforces it; asking the two predicates independently would
# double-count every draft note and turn the ordinary working state of a
# tracked-md workspace into an over-tracking report.
#
# `-z` with process substitution, never `$(…)`: bash command substitution DROPS
# NUL bytes, which would splice every path into one string. Without -z git
# C-quotes unusual names ("a\nb"), and a quoted path no longer ends in .md — so
# the classification, not just the splitting, depends on this.

# survive it. An unreadable index yields zero counts rather than an error: this

# --- Verdict (R4.1) ---------------------------------------------------------
# ONE ORDERED CHAIN, FIRST MATCH WINS, AND THE ORDER IS THE SPECIFICATION —
# not an artefact of how the arms happened to be written.
#
# CONTRADICTION OUTRANKS PARTIAL. A workspace can be both at once (tracked
# .draft/ files under an ignoring .gitignore) and it must report the
# contradiction: over-tracking is a housekeeping mistake the user can fix with
# one `git rm --cached`, while configuration fighting itself is the state that
# silently produces the kpranois and bentoolkit corpora. Reordering these arms
# would keep every current test green and quietly downgrade the one verdict
# this script was written to produce — do not.
#
# Each arm carries the noise argument for firing, because the story list shows
# a header line for every verdict that is not `consistent`.
VERDICT="consistent"
if [[ "$GITIGNORE_IGNORES_EPIC" == true && "$TRACKED_ANY" -gt 0 ]]; then

  # nothing in git will ever mention it.
  VERDICT="contradiction"
elif [[ "$GITIGNORE_IGNORES_EPIC" == true && "$POLICY" == "tracked-md" && "$TRACKED_MD" -eq 0 ]]; then

elif [[ "$TRACKED_DRAFT" -gt 0 ]]; then
  # Over-tracking. .draft/ is scratch space and is in NO policy's tracked set —
  # "never .draft/" is the story constraint — so this is a mismatch under
  # tracked-md, local-only and undeclared alike, and needs no declaration to be
  # wrong. Cheap to say and cheap to fix, so it is worth one line.

  # THE TWO GUARDS ARE BOTH NOISE CONTROL, and each removes a false positive a
  # plainer reading of "subset tracking" would produce:
  #   * tracked_md == 0 — the TOTAL subset, never a partial one. A working tree
  #     with some artifacts committed and a new story not yet committed is the
  #     normal state of every repository on earth; comparing the tracked set to
  #     the on-disk set would flag it on every list until the next commit.
  #   * untracked artifacts exist — a freshly initialised workspace that has no
  #     stories yet has nothing to add, so telling it to add something is a
  #     banner with no possible action behind it.
  VERDICT="partial"
elif [[ "$POLICY" == "local-only" && "$TRACKED_MD" -gt 0 ]]; then
  # Declared local-only, artifacts committed anyway. Not a contradiction — no
  # exclude rule is being fought, the user may simply have changed their mind
  # and not said so — but the declaration and the repository disagree, which is
  # precisely the flip-flop that leaves zombies behind.
  VERDICT="partial"

# Everything else is `consistent`, and two members of that set are worth naming
# because they are the common ones and both MUST stay silent:
#   * undeclared with nothing tracked — the default workspace, and the state of
#     this plugin's own repository (.epic/ in the root .gitignore, no
#     .gitpolicy, nothing tracked). A verdict here would fire on every list.
#   * undeclared with artifacts tracked and no exclude rule fighting them — a
#     perfectly coherent repository that simply never wrote the policy file
#     down. `undeclared` is low-signal by design and is surfaced by `stories
#     full` alone; init is the consumer that acts on it, by asking.

# --- JSON emission ----------------------------------------------------------
# `git: true` is emitted on this path so the flag the design defines for the

# testing `= false` both work, and neither has to tell an absent key (jq prints
# `null`) from a measured `false`.
# Booleans and counts are emitted BARE — never quoted — so `jq -r` yields
# true/false and an integer that `-gt` can compare. `gitignore_source` is bare
# too when there is nothing to name: JSON `null` is a literal, and `"null"`
