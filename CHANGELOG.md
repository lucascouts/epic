## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **`plugin.json` userConfig schema** — install was failing with `Validation errors: userConfig.*.type: Invalid option ...` because each entry now requires `type` (one of `string` | `number` | `boolean` | `directory` | `file`) and `title`. Added both fields to all five userConfig entries and converted numeric defaults from string (`"7"`, `"3600"`) to number (`7`, `3600`).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** — enables one-line install via `/plugin marketplace add lucascouts/epic` + `/plugin install epic@lucascouts`. Marketplace name: `lucascouts`; plugin `epic` sourced from the same repo (`source: "./"`).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-19
