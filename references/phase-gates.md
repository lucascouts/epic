## Gate Protocol

Each phase: generate artifact > **write to disk** > notify user > gate (approve / request changes / abort).

**Write-first, chat-minimal approach:** Artifacts are written directly to the story directory. **Never show full file contents in chat** — this wastes context and clutters the conversation. The user accesses files directly to review.

**Three-step notification pattern:**
1. **Before writing:** "Creating `story.md`..."
2. **After writing:** "Phase 1 written to `.epic/stories/NNN-name/story.md`. Review and approve to continue."
3. **User reviews the file directly** — they can edit it or request changes via chat.

- Do NOT paste artifact contents into the chat — the file IS the artifact
- If the user rejects a phase, offer cascade rollback (see below)
- If the user edits the file directly, read the updated version before proceeding to the next phase
- If the user aborts, delete the entire story directory
- In a headless run nobody reviews: the gate is taken as approved and the next phase starts ([triage.md](triage.md#runtime-dependency-precheck-mandatory-before-standardfull-triage))

**For a `layperson` requester the gate is one line, not a file review** — what will be built, in their words, and two answers: go on, or change something ([plain-register.md](plain-register.md#gates-are-one-line)). The artifact is written exactly as for anyone else; what changes is what they are asked to read. A layperson cannot evaluate a technical document, so their approval of one tells you nothing. Every gate counts against the story's question budget ([clarify.md](clarify.md#clarify-protocol)).

## Cascade Rollback

When a user rejects Phase N, determine the cause:

1. Ask: "What needs to change?"
   - **(a) This phase only** — rewrite the current phase artifact with different approach
   - **(b) Previous phase impact** — a requirement/decision in Phase N-1 needs to change
   - **(c) Abort** — cancel this story

2. If **(b)**, generate a **delta reverso** automatically:

```markdown
## Cascade Rollback: Phase N → Phase N-1

### Reason
[Why the current phase revealed a problem in the previous phase]

### Proposed Delta to [phase N-1 artifact]

#### MODIFIED
- [requirement/component]: [old] → [new]

#### IMPACTED
- [downstream items that may need re-evaluation]

### Action
1. Apply delta to [artifact]? [y/n]
2. If yes, re-approve [artifact]
3. Then regenerate current phase with updated constraints
```

3. Apply delta only after user approval, then regenerate the current phase.

## Section Progress

During phase generation, save incremental progress so a **new** session can tell which sections are done. An interruption inside the same conversation needs none of this: `claude --continue` (or `--resume`) reopens it with the partial artifact already on disk. This ledger is not Claude Code's `/checkpoint` (an alias of `/rewind`).

### Progress File Format

Before generating each major section of an artifact, write a `.wip` file:

```yaml
# .epic/stories/NNN-name/.draft/story.md.wip
progress: 3
sections_completed:
  - frontmatter
  - introduction
  - R1-user-registration
sections_pending:
  - R2-user-login
  - R3-logout
  - remaining-sections
```

The partial artifact is written to disk incrementally. A progress marker is inserted:

```markdown
<!-- PROGRESS:3 — resume from here -->
```

### Resume Procedure

On detecting a `.wip` file:

1. Read the `.wip` to determine progress
2. Present: "Found incomplete Phase N (M/T sections written: [list]). Resume from [next section], or restart Phase N?"
3. If resume: read the partial artifact, continue generating from the progress marker
4. If restart: delete the `.wip` and partial artifact, regenerate from scratch

### Rules

- `.wip` files are deleted after the phase artifact is complete (before gate)
- `.wip` files are always gitignored
- Only one `.wip` file per artifact at a time

## Reference Files Loaded Per Phase

| Phase | Feature Req-First | Feature Design-First | Bugfix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | `ears-notation.md` + `requirements.md` | `design-guide.md` | `bugfix.md` + `ears-notation.md` |
| Phase 2 | `design-guide.md` | `ears-notation.md` + `requirements.md` | `bugfix-design.md` |
| Phase 3 | `tasks.md` | `tasks.md` | `tasks.md` |

[quality-catalog.md](quality-catalog.md) is loaded with `requirements.md` — the `## Quality Requirements` legend is written in Phase 1 — and again with `tasks.md`, where the gates are generated from it, in every mode.

For Fast mode, `tasks.md` and `quality-catalog.md` are loaded — the legend lives at the top of `tasks.md`.
For Standard mode, Phase 1 + Phase 3 references are loaded.
[engineering-level.md](engineering-level.md) is loaded with `tasks.md` in every mode: what the quality catalog activates and the shape of Phase 3 are read from it.

On format doubts, load the relevant example from `assets/examples/`.

Additionally, if `.epic/constitution.md` is present, its relevant sections are loaded as constraints (the project's `CLAUDE.md` is already in context).

## Architect Sub-agent (Full mode, before Phase 2)

Before generating design.md, spawn the **Architect** sub-agent (`run_in_background: false`, result awaited), to research the codebase:

> "Provide design context for this story. Follow your agent definition: the Codebase analysis block is the Analyst's scan of this same tree — do not scan again; answer integration points against the written requirements, and the implementation gotchas.
>
> Story requirements: [path to story.md]
> Codebase analysis: [Analyst output from Context Discovery — `none: empty repository` when there was no code]"

The Architect output is injected as context when generating design.md. Skipped for Fast and Standard modes.

**Why the Architect is not asked to scan.** The Analyst output this prompt injects verbatim already answers patterns (Analyst step 1), conventions (step 2), library docs (step 4) and integration points, which the Analyst's own output format names. The first three have identical inputs — the same tree, the same request — so rescanning them at `effort: high` from an empty context is rediscovery and nothing else. Integration points are **re-scoped rather than duplicated**: the Analyst answers them against the raw request at triage, the Architect answers them against `story.md`, which did not exist yet. The gotcha hunt is the one task unique to this persona, and it is the one carrying a propagation rule. So the Architect answers only those two; on an empty repository there is nothing to integrate with, and its turns go to the gotchas.

**Gotcha propagation rule:** When the Architect identifies implementation gotchas, the main agent MUST incorporate them into the relevant task ToDo fields as concrete implementation notes — not as vague references to patterns. Example: instead of "use base layout pattern", write "parse each page template together with base.html into a separate template set — calling ExecuteTemplate on the page name alone will produce empty output". The gotcha must survive from research → design → task without losing specificity.

## Test Advisor Sub-agent (Standard + Full, during Phase 3)

**Only at engineering level `project` or `product`** ([engineering-level.md](engineering-level.md)). An `experiment` or `tool` story, whatever its scale, takes the Lite checklist below and writes its tests at run time — no Test Advisor is spawned, and no `.draft/authored-tests/` or `red-evidence.yaml` exists for it. Authoring every test before any code costs more wall clock than an `experiment` or `tool` story is worth.

After the main agent generates the task list structure (with Objective, ToDo, Validation, Requirements — but **without Tests fields**), spawn the **Test Advisor** sub-agent (`subagent_type: test-advisor`, defined in `agents/test-advisor.md`) — `run_in_background: false`, result awaited: Phase 3 cannot complete without its Red evidence, and a turn ended to wait for it is a turn the requester spends waiting ([personas.md](personas.md#personas)) — to define testing requirements per sub-task **and author one test file per Unit/Integration/E2E sub-task** (Unit/Integration are Red-verified in Phase 3; E2E defers Red to Run mode):

> "Analyze these tasks, define which sub-tasks need tests, and author the test files. Follow your agent definition — the determination, the authoring rules, the Red record and the report format live there.
>
> Story requirements: [path to story.md]
> Story scale: [Standard | Full]
> Design testing strategy: [testing strategy section from design.md, if exists]
> Design contract excerpts: [Full mode only — signatures/data shapes from design.md, per Unit/Integration sub-task]
> E2E tool: [the `E2E tool:` line of design.md's `## Tooling Decisions` — e.g. `playwright`, or `none`]
> Task list: [generated tasks WITHOUT Tests fields, and WITHOUT ToDo fields for authoring]
> Story directory: [.epic/stories/NNN-name]
> Project language/framework and test conventions: [detected from codebase analysis]"

The main agent merges the Test Advisor mapping into the task list before writing tasks.md to disk. The Test Advisor writes **only** inside the story's `.draft/` directory — the authored test files under `.draft/authored-tests/` and the Red evidence in `.draft/red-evidence.yaml` — and modifies no other project file. Every Unit/Integration test it authors must be confirmed Red before Phase 3 completes; an authored Unit/Integration test that passes blocks Phase 3 until revised (up to 2 attempts) or escalated to the user. An authored E2E test is not run in Phase 3 — its Red verification is deferred to Run mode and recorded as a `red_deferred: true` entry.

### Test Advisor Lite (Fast mode)

For Fast mode — and for a Standard or Full story at engineering level `experiment` or `tool` ([engineering-level.md](engineering-level.md)) — the main agent decides Tests inline (no sub-agent) using this 4-check checklist:

1. **State change?** Does this sub-task create/update/delete data?
   → YES: add at least 1 test that verifies resulting state (not just return code)
   → NO: skip

2. **Boundary?** Does this sub-task handle external input (HTTP, CLI, file)?
   → YES: add 1 happy path + 1 error path test
   → NO: skip

3. **Existing tests?** Does the modified code already have test coverage?
   → YES: verify existing tests still pass (add to Validation)
   → NO: apply rules 1-2 above

4. **Contract rule.** Every implementing sub-task carries either a `Tests` field or an `Acceptance` field — a sub-task with testable logic gets a `Tests` field, a structural sub-task with no testable logic gets an `Acceptance` field. A group-level `Commit:` field is exempt (it implements nothing).
   → checks 1-3 say a test is needed: add the `Tests` field
   → checks 1-3 say no test is needed: add an `Acceptance` field (1-3 observable-behavior statements)

Keep it lightweight — 1-2 test entries max per sub-task.

**For a Standard or Full story at `experiment` or `tool` level**, check 4 does not apply: a structural sub-task carries `Tests: None` with a one-line reason, as the Advisor would write, and anchors on its `Requirements` field; at `experiment` the `Tests` field is optional, as in a spike, and `Validation` is the proof.

**Plan time vs run time.** Unlike the full Phase 3, Fast — and an `experiment` or `tool` story at any scale — does **not** author tests at plan time — there is no Test Advisor sub-agent, no `.draft/authored-tests/`, and no `red-evidence.yaml`. This checklist only decides *whether* a test is needed and records that decision as the `Tests` or `Acceptance` field. The test-first ordering itself — authoring the test, confirming Red, then implementing — happens at run time (see `run-mode.md`).

## Reviewer Sub-agent (Full mode only)

After **all phases are written**, spawn the **Reviewer** sub-agent (`subagent_type: reviewer`, `run_in_background: false`, result awaited, defined in `agents/reviewer.md`) for cross-artifact validation:

> "Review these story artifacts as a set. Follow your agent definition.
>
> Files to read:
> - [path to story.md]
> - [path to design.md]
> - [path to tasks.md]"

The nine cross-artifact checks and the output format live in [reviewer.md](../agents/reviewer.md).

- If the Reviewer finds issues, present them to the user and offer to fix
- If clean, proceed to Traceability Check
- Reviewer does NOT modify files — only reports

## Traceability Check

After the final phase approval (standard and full scales only), generate a traceability table. **Build it from `cross-reference.sh`, never by hand-counting** — manual tallying is error-prone at scale. Run:

```bash
epic-xref .epic/stories/NNN-name
```

The JSON output carries everything the table needs: `mapping` is the requirement → sub-tasks relation, `orphan_requirements` lists requirements no task declares, `phantom_references` lists task references with no requirement. Render the table directly from those fields — task numbers come straight from `mapping`:

```markdown
| Requirement | Tasks | Status |
|---|---|---|
| R1.1 | 1.1 | Covered |
| R2.3 | — | No task |
| — | 5.1 | No requirement |
```

Rules:
- Built from the `cross-reference.sh` `mapping` field — never hand-counted
- Orphan requirements (`orphan_requirements`; empty `mapping` array) → warning shown to user
- Phantom references (`phantom_references`) → warning shown to user
- Warnings are informational — user decides whether to address them
- For bugfix stories, verify Unchanged Behavior items have regression test tasks
- If `status` is `clean`, show the table briefly and proceed to write
- Skipped for Fast mode (no requirements to trace)
