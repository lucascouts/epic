# Engineering Level

How long the thing must last decides how much the story pays for — in the quality catalog, in Phase 3, in the size of the plan. The scale ([SKILL.md](triage.md#adaptive-modes)) says which artifacts are written; the engineering level says how much engineering the work carries. They are independent axes: a Fast story can be a product's one-line fix, a Full story can be an experiment with three tracks.

This file is the single home of the four levels, their multiples and what each activates. Every consumer cites it and restates nothing but the numbers `tasks.md` owns; recalibrating a multiple is one edit here.

## The four levels

| Level | What it means | The question that reveals it | Expected cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `experiment` | Kept or thrown away as you like, but **not maintained** — no changes, no updates, no upkeep planned. You may well go on using it exactly as it is | "Do you intend to add features to this once it works, or are you just going to try it out with no intention of keeping it up?" — try it out | **1×** — the minimum that works, plus the security floor |
| `tool` | A minimum viable version, with the basics of good practice and its quality gates. Kept in use and fixed when it breaks, with no deadline and nobody else depending on it | "Besides you, is anyone else going to use it?" — no | **2–3×** |
| `project` | Maintained: updated with some regularity, and other people depend on it or contribute to it | "Besides you, is anyone else going to use it?" — yes | **4–6×** |
| `product` | May become a product. Market standards from the first commit | "Do you intend to offer it as a product or a service?" — yes | **8×+** |

The multiple is against the **control** — the same request answered by the model with no plan at all — in wall clock and in tokens, and it is what the level should cost, not what it is allowed to. **The owner's rule: up to 5× the control is justifiable; above it, something is wrong or unnecessary.** `project` and `product` may exceed 5× because they buy things the control never produces — a history, a CI, contract tests — and their multiples are read from measurements, never taken as a licence.

**Calibration.** The multiples above are targets, **recalibrated at every release** from the harness's own numbers — a figure here that the next round contradicts is rewritten, not defended. The runs a recalibration rests on belong to the release notes, not to this table.

## How the level is read

**Proposed at triage, from the request, and confirmed by the triage gate.** Triage reads the level the way it reads the requester ([SKILL.md](triage.md#triage-protocol)): from the words — "for a class", "to see if it works", "we ship this to customers", "my team" — and records it with the evidence. When the request does not settle it, the cascade below is asked rather than a level assumed. Measured 2026-09-18: defaulting to `tool` without asking put a beginner's throwaway CRUD at 9.4x its control in wall clock and 14.5x in cost, where `tool` promises 2-3x. `experiment` and `product` are never assumed: the first drops every check, the second buys every one.

**The proposal line carries the price, in one line — and the scale rides with it.** Whatever the level, the proposal states it in words the requester chooses by, **and names the scale beside it**: the scale decides which artifacts get written, and measured 2026-09-19 it moved the bill further than the level did (same requester, same request, same `experiment` level: `standard` cost 10.9× its control, `fast` cost 4.3×). A price the requester never sees is a price they cannot refuse.

> Engineering: tool — you will keep using this and fix it when it breaks, so I test each part as I build it. About 2–3× the time of a throwaway version. Say so if it is only for today, or if others will depend on it.

For a `layperson` the same line is one of the three lines of the plain-register proposal ([plain-register.md](plain-register.md)), and the level's name never reaches them — what they hear is how long it needs to last and what that costs. For a `developer` the term is used. Either way the triage gate confirms it, so the level costs no question of the budget.

**When triage is unsure, the level is fished for inside the orientation round — Round 0 of Clarify ([SKILL.md](clarify.md#clarify-protocol)), which already asks who uses the thing and what "done" looks like. The level's questions join that round as a cascade, and the cascade stops at the first answer that settles it.** The questions are asked as consequences, never as "which level is this?": a requester cannot grade their own engineering, but they know whether they intend to come back and change the thing.

1. *Do you intend to add features and capabilities to this project once it is finished, or are you just going to try it out with no intention of keeping it up?* → **try it out = `experiment`, and nothing further is asked**
2. *Besides you, is anyone else going to use it?* → no = `tool` · yes = continue
3. *Do you intend to offer it as a product or a service?* → no = `project` · yes = `product`
4. **Conditional, and only when an answer above opened it** — how the others receive it (a public repository, a private one, a file sent directly), and free or paid. These are separate questions that complete each other; one round cannot settle them all.

**No option in a level question is ever marked recommended, in any register.** A recommendation answers *what is the better engineering* — but this question asks *what do you intend to do with the thing*, and there is no better answer to that than the requester's own. Marking one is a category error, not a nudge. Measured 2026-09-19 on one commit: the `layperson` branch asked it as its own question, unmarked, with the price in plain words, while the `developer` branch folded it into the plan gate with `tool` pre-marked `(Recommended)`. **The layperson form is the correct one; the developer branch uses it too, changing only the vocabulary** — never the shape, never the marking, never the position. A technical question in the same round may carry a recommendation, and should; this one may not.

**These are intent rounds, and intent rounds do not count against the question budget** ([SKILL.md](clarify.md#clarify-protocol)). Technical rounds do. The cascade stops when a round changes neither the level nor the range of technology still open; where real ambiguity remains after that, ask for a free-text answer rather than offering a further set of options.

**The floor is `fast`, and it rises only when an answer pushes it — and it may come back down.** Going down is cheap; going up after the work has been paid for is not. When the answers move the level, the proposal line is restated once, with the new price, before Phase 1.

**A spike is an experiment by definition** and carries `experiment` or nothing.

## Where it is recorded

- **The frontmatter** of every artifact, beside `scale:` — `engineering: experiment | tool | project | product`. `tasks.md` is authoritative, as it is for the scale; a value outside the four is a validation error naming the set; absence is legal and silent.
- **`meta.yaml`**, beside the `requester` block, from the moment the level is proposed.
- **The run** — the execution plan and the end-of-run report both open with **the recorded line**: scale, requester level, engineering level with the multiple the level *expects*, and the plan size in Task List boxes — `standard · developer · tool (2–3×) · 11 boxes`; the report adds the wall clock and the boxes closed. That line is what the persona harness reads to compare a run against its control; a run without it is a run nobody can measure ([run-mode.md](run-mode.md#run-mode-rules)).

  **The report never states the multiple this run achieved.** It cannot: the multiple is against a control — the same request answered with no plan at all — and nobody ran one. `(2–3×)` in the recorded line is the level's *promise*, never a measurement, and the report must not restate it as an outcome. An estimate stated as a result errs in the direction that flatters the run. Report the wall clock and the tokens, which are measured; leave the ratio to whoever holds a control.

## What each level pays for

The level ties three things together. Each row is the whole difference between levels; everything not named here is the same at every level.

| | `experiment` | `tool` | `project` | `product` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Quality catalog** ([quality-catalog.md](quality-catalog.md)) | the **security floor** and nothing else — supported runtime, secrets, dependency CVEs ([quality-catalog.md](quality-catalog.md#the-security-floor--four-items-no-level-drops)); beyond those three the proof is that it runs | the **always** tier, **paid with defaults**: one command per item, its options on the command line, no configuration file for a checker ([quality-catalog.md](quality-catalog.md#always)) | always, plus every **context** item whose signal the tree or the request carries | always, every context item that applies, and the **CI-shaped** ones without waiting for a signal — pinned Actions, minimum dependency age, licence and SBOM — plus the **on-request** tier when a requirement names it |
| **Phase 3** ([phase-gates.md](phase-gates.md#test-advisor-sub-agent-standard--full-during-phase-3)) | tests optional, as in a spike: `Validation` is the proof | tests decided inline by the Lite checklist and **written at run time**, as Fast does — no Test Advisor, no `.draft/authored-tests/`, no `red-evidence.yaml` | the full Phase 3: the Test Advisor authors one failing test per Unit/Integration/E2E sub-task and records its Red | the same |

**Why Phase 3 is proportional.** Authoring the test at plan time buys an independent contract for the implementer, and that independence is worth its price when someone else will maintain the code; for a thing one person keeps for themselves, the test written at run time — Red before Green, the same cycle, no sub-agent — buys the same regression guard for a fraction of the clock. `experiment` and `tool` therefore land in the run-time test-first ordering that Fast and spike already use ([run-mode.md](run-mode.md#run-time-test-first-ordering)), whatever their scale; `project` and `product` pay the full Phase 3. Everything downstream that reads "Standard/Full" as "has a pre-authored test" reads it through this table: materialization, its converse guard, Refine's Red evidence for added sub-tasks and the Auditor's Red-precedence check all apply at `project` and `product` and are exempt below.

**Why there is no task-count ceiling.** **How many tasks a story has follows from the work, not from its level** — which is also how a work breakdown structure is built, bounding each package's size (the 8/80 heuristic) and never the count, and how agile story splitting works, which prescribes no number at all. A checkbox is not a unit of work: `.gitignore` and a whole module are each one. The level still decides the plan's *cost* — through what the quality catalog activates and through Phase 3 — and the plan keeps its one threshold on size in bytes ([tasks.md](tasks.md#authoring-ceiling)). The bound is on the unit: a sub-task is one Executor pass, with a `Validation:` command that proves it alone.

## What the level never changes

- The scale, the artifacts and the gates — a `product` Fast story is still `tasks.md` alone, an `experiment` Full story still has its design doc
- The requester level and the register — the two levels are read independently and recorded side by side
- The Executor's six steps, the closing of a box, the commit — the level decides how much is planned, never how a planned box is done
