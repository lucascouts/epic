## Post-Implementation Personas

These personas are activated **after implementation**, not during story creation. They are optional — activated when the user invokes `/epic:epic validate` on a story directory, or when a sub-agent execution flow completes all tasks.

| Persona | Role | When | Sub-agent type |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auditor** | Part 1: runs the validation commands, tests and gates ([validation-protocol.md](validation-protocol.md)). Part 2, on a pass: compares implemented code against story + design artifacts | validate mode | `auditor` |

**One spawn validates and audits.** A separate Validator would re-read the same story from an empty context before the Auditor read it again; measured side by side, the single spawn found every planted defect the pair found, faster and for less.

## Validation — Part 1 of the Auditor's spawn prompt

The first block of the one spawn prompt. The Auditor runs it before any audit check.

> "Validate the implementation of these completed tasks.
>
> Tasks file: [path to tasks.md]
> Story directory: [path to .epic/stories/NNN-slug]
> Completed tasks: [list of tasks marked `[x]`]
> Closed without work: [list of tasks marked `[~]`, each with its qualifier — these have nothing to run]
> Project root: [path]
>
> For each completed task and sub-task:
> 1. Run the Validation command specified in the sub-task
> 2. If a Tests field exists, verify the test file exists and tests pass
> 3. If the group carries a `Commit:` field, verify the commit was made (check git log)
>
> Then settle the Quality Gates: for each gate in the Quality Gates section, decide from the task results whether it is satisfied, and record it PASS or FAIL with its evidence. A generated gate — one carrying a `Qn` identifier and a command ([quality-catalog.md](quality-catalog.md)) — is settled by running that command: its exit status is the verdict and its output the evidence.
>
> Then, as the LAST step before composing any textual summary, write the whole verdict to `.draft/validation-report.yaml` in the story directory — creating `.draft/` on demand is part of that step, since fast and spike stories have none. The orchestrator concludes from that file, not from your reply:
>
> ```yaml
> story: "NNN-slug"                       # the story directory name
> generated_at: "<YYYY-MM-DD>T<hh:mm:ss>Z" # UTC, ISO 8601
> verdict: pass                           # pass | fail — fail when any result is FAIL
> results:
>   - task: "1.1"
>     result: PASS                        # PASS | FAIL | SKIP
>     qualifier: null                     # on a SKIP from a [~] box: deferred | waived | n-a | superseded-by
>     detail: "bats tests/foo.bats — 12 tests, 0 failures"
>   - task: "2.1"
>     result: SKIP
>     qualifier: deferred
>     detail: "closed without the work — needs the provider's live account"
> gates:
>   - gate: "All task validations pass"
>     result: PASS                        # PASS | FAIL
>     evidence: "no FAIL in results[]"
> ```
>
> One results[] entry per sub-task you were given, `[x]` and `[~]` alike, and one gates[] entry per Quality Gate. A SKIP never fails the run. A `[x]` sub-task with no runnable Validation command is FAIL, never SKIP; a command that hangs or waits for input is FAIL with its reason.
>
> Only then summarize in prose:
> - PASS: task N.N — validation succeeded
> - FAIL: task N.N — [what failed and why]
> - SKIP: task N.N — nothing to run (a `[~]` box closed without the work being done — name its qualifier)
> - each Quality Gate as PASS or FAIL with evidence
>
> Do NOT modify any other file: that report is your only write, and any other write is a protocol violation — report what is wrong, never fix it."

## Audit — Part 2 of the Auditor's spawn prompt

The second block of the same prompt, run only when Part 1's verdict is `pass` — on a finished story, or on the `[x]` boxes of a partial one. Performs a holistic review comparing what was planned vs what was built.

> "Review the implementation against the story and design artifacts.
>
> Story directory: [path to .epic/stories/NNN-slug]
>
> Files to read:
> - [path to story.md]
> - [path to design.md] (if exists)
> - [path to tasks.md]
> - [path to .draft/deviations.yaml] (if exists)
>
> Prior structural findings on this project (from memory — verify each against the code, and cite only what a file shows; a finding resting on this list alone is a protocol violation): [memory hits, or "none"]
>
> Check:
> 1. Every requirement in story.md is implemented (trace to actual code, not just task checkboxes). A criterion carrying the `(satisfied-by: <artifact>)` suffix is traced to THAT ARTIFACT instead — confirm it exists and answers the criterion, and do not report it as a coverage gap. A suffix naming an artifact that does not exist IS a finding.
> 2. Every component in design.md exists in the codebase with the specified interfaces
> 3. Error handling strategy in design.md is followed in the actual handlers/controllers
> 4. Security considerations in design.md are addressed in the implementation
> 5. Testing strategy levels in design.md all have corresponding test files
> 6. Quality gates in tasks.md are all satisfied
> 7. Scope creep, against a baseline — only what this story provably added (the files its `type(NNN):` commits touched, or with none yet, the files its sub-tasks name plus the uncommitted changes) can be scope creep; code whose origin you cannot tie to this story is an `info` finding at most
> 8. If deviations.yaml exists: for each deviation, verify the stated impact is accurate and no downstream breakage occurred. For each deviation marked with limited impact, check actual callers of the deviated component to confirm.
> 9. If deviations.yaml has discoveries: verify each discovery was addressed in subsequent tasks (e.g., if a template engine gotcha was found, check that later tasks using templates account for it)
> 10. Red precedence — at engineering level `project` or `product` ([engineering-level.md](engineering-level.md)), read from tasks.md's frontmatter `engineering:` — `project` when absent; at `experiment` or `tool`, as for Fast and spike, the Red lives in the run report and this check is skipped with `missing_red` left empty: every sub-task whose `Tests:` field is **not `None`** has both a pre-authored test and an entry in `.draft/red-evidence.yaml` with `failed: true` (or `red_deferred: true` for `E2E`); a missing entry is reported as a finding. Since Red evidence is recorded in Phase 3 and implementation happens in Run, the entry's existence establishes precedence by construction. Quantify over the `Tests:` field, never over the set of authored tests — a sub-task added by a refinement after Phase 3 ran has no authored test, so "every sub-task with a pre-authored test" excludes the very sub-task that is broken. Report a non-`None` `Tests:` field with no authored test as its own finding.
>
> Then, as the LAST step before composing any textual summary, write the whole audit to `.draft/audit-report.yaml` in the story directory — creating `.draft/` on demand is part of that step, since fast and spike stories have none. The orchestrator concludes from that file, not from your reply; the head is the validation report's, key for key, so one reader parses both:
>
> ```yaml
> story: "NNN-slug"                       # the story directory name
> generated_at: "<YYYY-MM-DD>T<hh:mm:ss>Z" # UTC, ISO 8601
> verdict: pass                           # pass | fail — see below
> gaps:

> Every array is present even when empty (`gaps: []`) — only the empty one says checked and clean. `verdict` is `fail` when any gap, unmet gate, inaccurate deviation or `missing_red` entry exists, and `pass` otherwise; scope creep and checklist findings are advisory, never held against the run. `missing_red`'s `kind` keeps the two absences apart: `no-entry` for a pre-authored test with no Red evidence, `no-test` for a non-`None` `Tests:` field with no test at all.

## Validate Mode Procedure

1. Resolve story directory from NNN
2. Read tasks.md and take the checkbox census. A story is **complete** when **no `[ ]` remains**: it is **`done`** when every box is `[x]` or terminal `[~]` (`waived:`, `n-a:`, `superseded-by:`), and **`done-except-external`** when the only non-`[x]` boxes are `[~] (deferred: …)`. `done-except-external` is computed at read time, never written to a file. Only `[x]` sub-tasks have an implementation to validate — see [tasks.md](tasks.md#completion)
3. Delete the stale `.draft/validation-report.yaml` and `.draft/audit-report.yaml`, then spawn **one** Auditor sub-agent (`run_in_background: false`) and wait for its completion. It runs the validation first — each task's validation command, tests and gates, per [validation-protocol.md](validation-protocol.md) — and writes `.draft/validation-report.yaml`; on a validation pass it goes on to compare the code against story + design, review the deviation register, and write `.draft/audit-report.yaml`. The spawn prompt is the two blocks below, validation first. When memory is available, it carries prior structural findings recalled with one `memory_query` — `audit OR scope-creep OR false-positive OR recurring`, `limit: 10` — as things to verify ([mcp-integration.md](mcp-integration.md#memory-mcp))
4. Take the validation verdict from the file `.draft/validation-report.yaml`. On `verdict: fail` the audit file is absent by design — the run is a validation failure. On `verdict: pass`, take the audit verdict from the file `.draft/audit-report.yaml` the same way
5. Present the combined results to the user, composed from the two files: the validation's `results[]` and `gates[]`, the audit's `gaps[]`, `unmet_gates[]`, `deviations_reviewed[]`, `scope_creep[]`, `missing_red[]` and `findings[]`
6. If gaps found, offer to create new tasks to address them — **bounded to two fix rounds**, see [Fix loop bound](#fix-loop-bound)
7. Apply the status transition for this verdict — see Status Transition (`validated`)
7a. **Memory write (when memory is available)** — for each `findings[]` entry that is structural by the Auditor's own criterion (likely to recur in this codebase: a recurring scope-creep pattern, a false-positive deviation, a project-specific gate failure) and for each `deviations_reviewed[]` entry with `accurate: false`, write or rewrite one page at `epic/audit/<subject-slug>.md`: H1 = the subject, body = the finding, the story it came from and the file/line evidence. Same subject, same path — a finding seen again rewrites its page, and that rewrite is the supersession. A story-specific bug gets no page; it belongs to the tasks step 6 offers ([mcp-integration.md](mcp-integration.md#memory-mcp))
8. On a passing verdict, surface **at most one** integration warning when it applies — run `story-git-status.sh` once, then either report its `anchored_commits == 0` sentence or pipe the same JSON into `epic-integration --validate <NNN>`, which writes the sentence or nothing — then offer the archive and refresh the index. See Ordering at the pass point, then Integration Warning (and its precedence table), Archive Offer and Index Refresh

### Fix loop bound

A **fix round** is one pass of the loop validate fails → fix tasks are created and run → validate again. Unbounded, it is the most expensive thing Epic does: every round re-runs the whole suite and re-reads the whole story in the Auditor, and a finding the fix did not settle — or a new one the fix introduced — sends it round again.

- **The round is counted from tasks.md, never remembered.** The group step 6 creates is titled `Validation fixes — round N`; the next round is one more than the highest `N` already in the file.
- **Every offer states what a round costs**: the fix run plus one Auditor spawn, which validates and audits. When `epic-telemetry` measured this validation, give its `subagent` tokens and its wall clock as the price of the revalidation.
- **Round 1** — offered as step 6 always offered it.
- **After a fix round runs, the revalidation is asked, never chained.** Neither Run mode nor this mode starts VALIDATE on its own after a `Validation fixes` group closes; the next-step question at the end of that run offers it, stating the round and its cost ([run-mode.md](run-mode.md#end-of-run--next-step-index)).
- **Round 2 is the last one offered.** When the validation that follows round 2 still fails, step 6 creates no round 3: present what remains, say two rounds did not settle it, and recommend refining the story, since a finding that survives two fixes is usually a plan problem, not an implementation one. A third round runs only when the user asks for it in so many words.
- **Headless** takes the recommended option at each point — so it runs at most round 1, never revalidates on its own, and logs the command instead.

### The verdict is the file; the reply is a courtesy

Each part writes its report as the **last** step of that part, before composing any prose ([validation-protocol.md](validation-protocol.md), [auditor.md](../agents/auditor.md)), and steps 3-5 conclude from those two files. The final message is a convenience for the human reading along and **the source of no pass/fail decision** — an agent that ends on an intermediate line swallows its own reply, and the verdict is on disk regardless. Without the file, recovering a swallowed verdict costs a `SendMessage` round, or a respawn that re-runs the entire suite.

**Read `verdict`; never re-derive it.** Each part computes its own by its own rule — a SKIP never fails the validation, and scope creep and checklist findings never fail the audit — so a second derivation here is a second rule, and two rules disagree on the first story that tells them apart. The arrays are what step 5 presents and step 6 turns into tasks, never what the pass/fail is computed from.

### Before the spawn, delete both stale report files

Step 3 removes `.draft/validation-report.yaml` and `.draft/audit-report.yaml` immediately before the spawn. Once the agent fails to write, a leftover from a prior run is indistinguishable from a fresh verdict — and *does the file exist* is exactly the test step 4 performs, so without the delete the flow reads last week's `pass` as this run's.

**Both, because one spawn writes both.** A validation `fail` ends the spawn with no audit report, and an audit file left over from an earlier pass would then read as this run's audit.

**Deleting what is not there is a no-op, never an error, and never a reason to skip the spawn.** A fast or spike story has no `.draft/` at all — the Auditor creates it on demand — so a missing file and a missing directory are the ordinary first-run state.

### Absent or unparseable: one re-request, then the run is failed

Apply the first row that matches, once the agent returns:

| # | The report file | Then |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Present and parses | read `verdict` and carry on — the ordinary case |
| 2 | Absent, empty, truncated, or not parseable as YAML | **one** `SendMessage` to the **same agent** and **never a second**, asking it to write its report file now, then wait for that agent's completion notification before reading the file again |
| 3 | Still absent or still unparseable after that one request | **the run is failed** — report it in those terms and stop |

**One request and never a second, to the agent that already did the work**, because it still holds the context that produced the verdict: re-emitting the file costs a message rather than a validation suite.

**Never respawn silently.** A respawn re-runs every command and every test — precisely the cost the file exists to save — and a second agent that also ends on an intermediate line leaves the flow looping over one failure. Running validate again is the user's call, made with the failure in view.

**Never infer a verdict from prose.** Whatever the agent did say — including a summary that reads like a clean pass — is not a verdict, and the verdict-is-the-file rule has no exception for a missing file: a verdict assembled from chat is the unverifiable claim the file exists to replace.

A failed run **writes no status and makes no offer** — rule 3 below, reached as any failure reaches it.

## Status Transition (`validated`)

Validate mode owns exactly one of the six `status:` values — `validated` — and writes it at exactly one point: a passing verdict. It never writes any of the other five; those belong to CREATE, RUN, the supersede operation and the archive operation. See [lifecycle-status.md](lifecycle-status.md#lifecycle-status-status) for the full field spec.

**The write mechanism is defined once**, in [run-mode.md](run-mode.md#status-transitions) — `Edit` on the frontmatter line and never `Write`, the same value in every artifact that carries frontmatter, the `Edit` adding the field on a legacy story that never had one. Validate mode reuses it unchanged; restating it here is exactly how the two copies would drift apart. A failed write is reported and the flow continues: `status:` is advisory metadata and must never change, delay or block the verdict it is recording.

**The verdict read here is the files'.** Rules 1-3 turn on the `verdict` field of `.draft/validation-report.yaml` and `.draft/audit-report.yaml` — never on what an agent said in chat, and never on a re-derivation from their arrays (see The verdict is the file, above). Apply the first rule that matches:

| # | The verdict | Then |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Both files read `verdict: pass`, and no `[ ]` remains | write `validated` (nothing to do if the field already reads `validated`) |
| 2 | Both files read `verdict: pass`, and at least one `[ ]` remains | write nothing — report the pass and state why the status was not advanced |
| 3 | Either file reads `verdict: fail`, or no verdict was readable at all | write nothing — leave `status:` exactly as it was |

**Rule 2 — a partial validation must not manufacture the lie.** `/epic:epic stories validate NNN` can be invoked at any time, including on a story that still has open `[ ]` boxes: the validation simply has fewer `[x]` sub-tasks to run, and it can still pass. Writing `validated` there would immediately trip `validate-story.sh`'s ahead-of-checkboxes warning — `done` or `validated` while a `[ ]` remains — so the engine would have written the exact claim that check exists to expose. Report the pass instead, and say why the status stayed where it is: **`validated` means "the finished story was verified", not "the part that exists so far looks fine".** When the remaining boxes close, Run mode writes its own transition, and the next passing verdict earns `validated`.

**Rule 3 — a failing verdict writes nothing at all.** Not `in-progress`, and not a rollback of a `validated` left by an earlier pass. A failure is a report, not a lifecycle transition; the story keeps whatever state its last real transition recorded. A run failed for want of a readable report lands here too: an unknown verdict is not a passing one.

**`in-progress → validated`, skipping `done`.** A story whose only non-`[x]` boxes are `[~] (deferred: …)` never receives `done`: Run mode writes `done` only when no `[ ]` **and** no deferred `[~]` remains, so such a story stays `in-progress` (see [run-mode.md](run-mode.md#status-transitions)). Nothing blocks it from being validated. Rule 1 asks for no `[ ]`, and a deferred box is closed, not open — the same reading `validate-story.sh` applies, whose ahead-of-checkboxes check counts `[ ]` only, so `validated` on a `done-except-external` story raises no warning. Such a story therefore runs `in-progress → validated`, skipping `done` entirely.

**The edge follows from two rules**: `done` is withheld while a deferred box remains, and `validated` is granted on a passing verdict. It is written down here rather than left implicit because an undocumented edge in a state machine is how the next maintainer gets it wrong.

**Ordering at the pass point.** Four things happen on a passing verdict, in this fixed order.

| # | Step | Owner | Why here |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Integration warning — validation passed but the story's work is not integrated into the main branch, or carries no anchor for the detection to find | Integration Warning, below | The caveat reaches the user before anything acts on the verdict |
| 2 | The status write above (`validated`) | this section | — |
| 3 | Archive offer, gated on a status of `validated` | Archive Offer, below | Its gate is true only once step 2 has written the value, and `validated` is the one status `archive-story.sh` accepts without `--force` |
| 4 | Index refresh — regenerate the managed block in `.epic/EPIC.md` | Index Refresh, below | It renders what steps 2 and 3 changed: the new status, and the story's new location when the archive was accepted |

This section fixes the order and the reason for it — each step's behavior is defined where its Owner column points.

**The chain is `verdict` → `status:` → offer, and every link is a file.** Rules 1-3 read the two reports' `verdict`, step 2 writes the status they decide, step 3's gate reads that status back, and step 4 renders what steps 2 and 3 changed. No link in it consults an agent's chat message.

## Integration Warning

Step 1 of the pass point. A passing verdict says the work is finished; whether it ever reached the main branch is a fact the checkboxes cannot see — every story can be checkbox-complete with nothing merged. The detection is the same live evaluation LIST annotates from, defined in [list-mode.md](list-mode.md#integration-annotation): computed live, stored nowhere, blocking nothing.

**The warning is rendered by the same script LIST annotates from** — [`scripts/render-integration.sh`](../scripts/render-integration.sh), asked for a different rendering of the same JSON — so the sentence the user reads is the sentence the test suite pins. On a passing verdict, pipe the detector into its `--validate` mode and append whatever comes back to the presented results:

```
epic-git-status <story-dir> \
  | epic-integration --validate <NNN>
```

`<NNN>` is the story number **as the reader knows it** and is interpolated verbatim — pass `006`, not `6`. What the script writes, per the `integrated` field of the detector's JSON (`{story, main_branch, integrated, evidence, anchored_commits, checked_at}`), **documents its three arms rather than prescribing a rendering to perform by hand**:

| `integrated` | The script writes |
|---|---|
| `false` | the warning below, appended to the presented results |
| `true` | nothing — the work is on the main branch |
| `null` | nothing at all — no main branch is resolvable, so the fact is unknowable |

Exit 2 from the detector — not a git repository, or story not found — also emits nothing at all: nothing reaches the pipe and `--validate` degrades silently, the same rule LIST applies. "Not computable" must never dress up as a finding, and a failed detection must never delay, dirty or block the verdict it decorates.

The sentence, spelled once in the script and reproduced here verbatim, with `<main>` filled from the JSON's `main_branch` and `NNN` the number passed on the command line:

```
story is done but no evidence of integration to <main> (no merged feat/NNN-* branch, no (NNN) commit)
```

`<main>` is read out of the report and never assumed: the detector resolves the default branch through four ordered candidates and it is regularly not named `main`, so a hard-coded name would print a branch the reader does not have. The sentence names the two evidence kinds the detection looked for and found missing — a merged `feat/NNN-*` branch (`branch-merged`) and a commit subject reachable from main carrying the `(NNN)` token (`message-ref`). Either alone would have flipped `integrated` to `true`.

**A warning, never a verdict.** Appending it changes nothing else: not the pass, not step 2's status write, not step 3's offer, not the validation's exit semantics. The script holds its half by construction: **every rendering path exits 0**, warning or no warning, so there is no exit status to read and nothing here to branch on — a caller that checked `$?` would turn the warning into a verdict. The one non-zero exit that is not the cost decision (`--should-annotate`, see [list-mode.md](list-mode.md#integration-annotation)) is exit 2, an unknown or missing mode: a caller error, unreachable from a well-formed call.

**When to ask is this mode's half, and the script cannot check it.** The warning's first three words are a precondition — "story is done" is true only on a passing verdict with no `[ ]` left — and the renderer renders whatever JSON it is handed. Rule 2's partial pass must therefore not call it at all: there the sentence would manufacture the very claim rule 2 exists to refuse.

**It never gates the archive.** `archive-story.sh`'s preflight does not consult integration state — an un-integrated story archives exactly like an integrated one. Whether a warned story needs a merge, a cherry-pick or nothing at all is the user's decision; the warning informs that decision and blocks nothing.

### The anchor warning, and which of the two fires

The detector answers **two nested questions**, and step 1 surfaces **at most one** of them. `integrated` asks *did this story's work reach the main branch*. `anchored_commits` — the number of commit subjects reachable from **HEAD** carrying this story's number as a delimited token, by the same `(NNN)` / `NNN-slug` rules the `message-ref` evidence kind applies — asks the question underneath it: *is the work findable at all*. Zero means this story's commits carry nothing that any detector can attribute back to it, on the main branch or anywhere else.

**Counted from HEAD, not from the main branch**, and that is what keeps the two questions apart: a just-validated story normally still sits on its own unmerged branch, so a main-relative count would read zero for every correctly anchored story awaiting its merge — the state the integration warning above already covers.

Same precondition as that warning — a passing verdict with no `[ ]` left, so `status:` reads `done` or `validated` — and the same severity. **A warning, never a verdict.** It is non-blocking and changes nothing else: not the pass, not step 2's status write, not step 3's offer, not the archive. The sentence, with `NNN` the story number as the reader knows it:

```
this story's commits carry no (NNN) anchor — integration detection cannot see them
```

**Run the detector once and decide from its JSON.** The count and `integrated` come out of the same object, so the pipe shown above becomes a second use of that object rather than a second detection — two runs could disagree, and the detector is the expensive half:

```
status_json=$(epic-git-status <story-dir>) || status_json=""
# then, only when the table below says so:
printf '%s\n' "$status_json" | epic-integration --validate <NNN>
```

**Precedence — apply the first rule that matches.** Left to themselves the two warnings double-fire on one story: a story with no anchored commits has no `message-ref` evidence either, so `integrated` is usually `false` for the very same underlying fact, and the user reads two sentences about one problem.

| # | The detector's JSON | Step 1 surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `integrated: null` — or nothing on the pipe at all, the detector's exit 2 | nothing whatsoever, whatever the count says |
| 2 | `anchored_commits == 0` | the anchor sentence above, and the `--validate` render is **not** run |
| 3 | `integrated` reads `false` | the integration sentence, from the render above |
| 4 | anything else — `integrated` reads `true` | nothing; the work reached the main branch |

`anchored_commits == 0` **wins** over rule 3 because it is the more specific finding: there is nothing for the detection to see at all, and "merge your branch" is the wrong instruction for a story whose commits carry no anchor to find. The integration warning therefore fires **only when** the story has anchored commits and none of them reached the main branch — the case it was written for.

`integrated: null` silences both, and it is first for that reason. No main branch resolved, so nothing was measured, and *"not computable" must never dress up as a finding* — the rule stated verbatim one field over, applied here to the pair rather than to one of them. `anchored_commits` can be `null` on the same principle, when the count itself was not computable (a repository with no commits at all): it is not `0`, so rule 2 does not match and the count simply adds nothing to a decision rules 3 and 4 already made without it. That combination is close to unreachable in practice — a repository with no commits resolves no main branch either, so rule 1 catches it first — and it is written down because a silence that depends on being unreachable is a silence nobody can check.

## Archive Offer

Step 3 of the pass point, and **the single definition of the offer**. Run mode never makes it — a run ends at `done`, and its next step is this mode ([run-mode.md](run-mode.md#end-of-run--next-step-index)); [supersede](supersede-mode.md#the-archive-offer) reuses this section for a story absorbed by another. A second copy of a prompt that spends guards is how one of the copies ends up spending them differently.

**Why here.** Archiving is the step most easily skipped, and right after a passing validate is when it is most likely to be done. Offering it anywhere else asks the user to remember; offering it here asks them to confirm.

### Gate

Offer when **both** hold:

1. Both report files read `verdict: pass` **and no `[ ]` remains** — rule 1 of the status table above.
2. `status:` reads **`validated`** after step 2.

**Archive follows validation, and only validation.** When step 2's write failed, the field still reads `done`: report the failure and make no offer — `archive-story.sh` would refuse a story that is not `validated` anyway, and an offer the script refuses is a question wasted. Any other way out — unfinished work, a story absorbed by another — is the user's `--force <reason>`, never this offer's.

**A partial pass never offers.** Rule 2 — a pass with at least one `[ ]` still open — writes no status and makes no offer, whatever the field already says. `archive-story.sh` would not stop it either: its completion check is an **OR** (frontmatter `status` of `done`/`validated`/`superseded` **or** no `[ ]` remaining), so a story left reading `validated` by an earlier pass satisfies preflight with an open box still in the file. The gate is therefore ours to hold. The offer means *this story is finished*, and proposing the archive over open work would stamp unfinished work as complete.

### The prompt

One `AskUserQuestion` — *Archive* first with the recommended marker in the user's language, *Keep it* second. It is the only next step this point offers, since validate has just run and refine has nothing to act on. In logs and below, it is written in its short form:

```
Archive story NNN? [y/n]
```

When the census shows deferred boxes — the computed condition `done-except-external`, defined once in [tasks.md](tasks.md#completion) — list them under the question, so the user accepts with the outstanding work in view:

```
Archive story 003? [y/n]
  Still owed by an external actor (2 deferred):
    - 2.1 — Register the production callback URL (deferred: needs the provider's live account)
    - 2.2 — Verify the first live event (deferred: needs a real payment in production)
```

Render each line as `N.N — title (qualifier: reason)` — the exact shape `archive-story.sh` derives into the manifest entry's `deferred_items[]`, so what the offer shows is what the archive will record.

**The items are shown, never passed.** On acceptance the offer hands the script **no** item list and no counts: `archive-story.sh` derives `deferred_items[]`, `tasks_total`, `tasks_closed` and `tasks_deferred` from the checkboxes itself. Declaring them at the call site would make the manifest hand-declared, and a hand-declared manifest can contradict the boxes it summarizes.

### On `[y]`

```
epic-archive <story-dir>
```

The story number (`005`) works in place of the directory — it resolves against the nearest `.epic/`. Pass **no flags**. `--allow-heavy`, `--skip-secrets`, `--keep-logs`, `--keep-copies` and `--force <reason>` are the user's decisions and each is recorded in the manifest entry as an override: an override the engine chose for itself is an override nobody agreed to. The one `--force` an offer passes is supersede's, and only because its question names the flag and the reason before the user accepts ([supersede-mode.md](supersede-mode.md#the-archive-offer)). Never re-run a blocked archive with a guard flag on your own initiative — report the verdict and let the user ask for the override by name.

The script prints **one JSON object on stdout**, diagnostics on stderr. Surface the verdict by its `status`:

| Exit | `status` | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `archived` | The move is done. Report `path`, `tasks{}`, `pruned{logs_kb, copies_removed}`, `overrides_used[]` when non-empty, and `secrets` — including a `skipped` scan, because a scan that did not happen is part of the verdict. `index: "regen-failed"` is a warning, not a failure: the story is archived and the next refresh retries |
| 1 | `blocked` | A guard stopped it. Report `reason` plus every `guard.violations[]` entry (`file`, `size`, `reason`) and `secrets` (`findings`, `report`) verbatim. **Nothing was moved** |
| 1 | `refused` | Preflight said no — already archived, incomplete without `--force`, not a story directory. Report `reason` verbatim. **Nothing was moved** |
| 2 | — | Invalid input, and **no JSON is printed at all**. Report the stderr message: this is a bad invocation, not a user decision |

**Never swallow a `blocked` or a `refused`.** Report the verdict in full, including the offending files and the findings count. A refusal the user cannot see is indistinguishable from an archive that happened.

### On `[n]`

One line, no argument, no second ask: the story stays in `.epic/stories/`. The offer returns on the next passing verdict, and `/epic:epic stories archive NNN` runs the same script at any time.

### Headless

**Only when `AskUserQuestion` is not callable** — not listed among the tools, directly or as a deferred tool to load, per [triage.md](triage.md#runtime-dependency-precheck-mandatory-before-standardfull-triage): do **not** pause. Emit the offer as a logged note, with its command, and proceed immediately — the archive is never performed without an accepted offer. **While the tool is callable, ask with it**: `--auto` and a missing Task tool do not count as headless here, because the offer comes after the gates `--auto` answers, and an offer written as prose is an offer nobody can accept. The Task tools are never the signal — Claude Code offers them only on some models.

The note names the command, so a logged suggestion is still actionable:

```
Archive suggestion: story 003 is validated and complete (2 deferred, still owed
externally). To archive it, run:
  epic-archive 003
```

## Index Refresh

Step 4 of the pass point, and **the single definition of the completion-time refresh** — Run mode invokes it at the end of a completed run and LIST refreshes it opportunistically, both pointing here.

```
epic-index
```

It regenerates the managed block between the `<!-- epic:index:start -->` / `<!-- epic:index:end -->` markers in `.epic/EPIC.md` and preserves every byte outside them.

**Why it runs last.** It renders state, so it must run after the state changes: after step 2's `status:` write, and after step 3 resolves. An accepted archive moved the directory and `archive-story.sh` already regenerated the block as its own final step — the refresh is then a zero-diff no-op, which is exactly what idempotent buys here. A declined offer leaves only the new status to render.

**A non-zero exit warns and never gates the verdict.** Exit 1 is a failed regeneration (a broken marker pair, an unreadable or unwritable file — the file is left untouched); exit 2 is invalid input. The index is a rendering of the truth, not the truth: a stale rendering is never a reason to hold, delay or reverse a verdict, and the next refresh retries.
