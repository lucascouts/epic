# The surface is agent-executed prose, so every case pins a BLOCK found by a
# structural anchor (a heading, a numbered step) and asserts a keyword inside
# it, case-insensitively. No case requires a sentence verbatim: a correct
# rewrite of the prose must stay green.
#
#   M1  mcp-integration.md has a Memory MCP section that names the health
#       check, Fast (memory is the one check Fast does not skip) and the opt-out
#   M2  the same section carries the three hard rules: memory is never
#       evidence, memory_feedback is never called, ignore_paths is recommended
#   M3  SKILL.md triage has a memory step that names Fast, and the proposal
#       block has a Memory line
#   M4  context-discovery.md has a Prior Knowledge section naming both reads
#       and scoped to all scales
#   M5  run-mode.md recalls at the procedure and writes the deviations page at
#       End of Run, at a stable path
#   M6  validate-mode.md hands prior findings to the Auditor as things to
#       verify, and writes audit pages at a stable path
#   M7  plugin.json exposes aiMemory, default auto
#   M8  init-mode.md recommends ignore_paths
#   M9  no agent definition gained a memory tool — the orchestrator is the only
#       writer, and the agents' own memory directories are untouched
#
# Note on awk patterns: passed as strings, so no backslash escapes; literal
# punctuation goes in a bracket class.
