# Policy test for the reports-by-artifact contract.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE PINS. Reports-by-artifact turns the Validator's and Auditor's
# verdicts into files (.draft/validation-report.yaml, .draft/audit-report.yaml)
# written BEFORE the textual summary, makes validate-mode conclude from those
# files rather than from the agent's final message, and gives the Tech Reviewer
# Bash restricted to measurement. All of that is prose in agent definitions and
# mode references — nothing executable — so the contract survives future edits
# only if a test names it. This file is that test.
#
# FIXTURES ARE THE REPO FILES THEMSELVES. Every case is a pure content
# assertion on agents/*.md, references/validate-mode.md and
# references/run-mode.md — no temp dirs, no mutation, so no mktemp/teardown.
#
# ASSERTIONS ARE BEHAVIOR-LEVEL, NOT SENTENCE-PINNED. Cases assert that a
# fact is stated (a filename, a grant, an ordering, a prohibition), matched
# case-insensitively on flattened text where a sentence may wrap — never an
# exact sentence, which would make every future rewording a false Red.
#
# ...BUT THEY PIN POLARITY, NOT CO-OCCURRENCE. Behavior-level is not
# direction-blind. A bare window pattern like `the run[^.]{0,40}fail` is
# satisfied by "the run is **not** failed" exactly as by the real row, so it
# stays green through an inversion of the rule it exists to guard. A
# directional claim therefore carries its polarity token INSIDE the match
# (`is failed`, `is a protocol violation`, `is your own store`,
# `never … respawn`), leaving no gap for a negation to slip between the anchors.
# Tighten only what is measured first: scope the section, count the candidate
# spans, and confirm the phrase is the one the rule's own name already uses —
# otherwise the pin becomes the sentence-pinning this header forbids above.
#
# Each such pattern is written out, never routed through a shared polarity
# helper. A helper that rejected a negation in the window before the match would
# false-Red on correct prose right here: auditor.md's memory clause reads "is
# not a second path in the code under audit — it is your own store", so a
# negation sits one clause ahead of the match by design.
#
# WHEN THE NEGATION PREFIXES A QUANTIFIER there is no polarity token to move
# inside. `is failed` works because the negation splits two anchors; `one`
# offers no such gap — it is a substring of every phrase that reverses it
# (`more than one`, `not just one`, `one or more`), so a pattern pinning `one`
# is satisfied by its own negation. No pattern repairs that, so the repair is
# not a pattern. It is three assertions and a prose rule: the rule carries a
# token a reversal BREAKS rather than contains (`never a second`), the case
# counts the sites that state it, and a third assertion pins the rule's
# CONSEQUENCE — one request, then the run is failed — because a document
# licensing repeats cannot also say that. An inline negated grep naming the
# claim's own modifiers stands BESIDE them, for the one vector only it catches
# rather than as the sanctioned form, and never as a generic negation guard,
# for the reason the paragraph above gives. All four stand in `an absent or
# unparseable report is re-requested once via SendMessage, then the run is
# failed`, which argues each where it stands.
#
# A NEGATED ASSERTION MUST NOT REST ON BEING LAST. Bash exempts a `!`-inverted
# command from errexit, so anywhere but the final statement of an @test its
# non-zero status is discarded and the assertion is inert — green whatever the
# file under test says: `! true` followed by one more assertion passes, while
# `if true; then return 1; fi` in that same slot fails. The sanctioned shape is
# therefore `if …; then return 1; fi`, which is what every negated assertion in
# this file uses. The subshell `( ! … )` also survives being moved and is not
# used for diagnostics alone — bats names the `return 1` line for the `if` and
# only the `@test` line for the subshell, pointing at the case instead of the
# assertion.
#
# THAT RULE IS ENFORCED, NOT ADVISED, and it is one of the few sentences in
# this header that may say so. The negated-assertion lint in
# tests/assertion-hygiene.bats scans every tests/*.bats and names each offender
# as file:line; it admits no position exemption, so sitting last is not a
# defence either. The sites are not listed here: a list has to be remembered,
# and the lint is re-derived on every run.
#
# WHERE THE POLARITY RULE DOES NOT HOLD, named rather than quietly excepted: a
# convention the file contradicts gets read as an invariant, which is worse
# than no convention. THIS HEADER IS NOT WHERE THOSE SITES ARE NAMED. A
# hand-kept list of exceptions is the same instrument as the hand-kept list of
# negations above, with the same failure: its entries go on reading as open
# after the sites are closed.
#
# THE ALLOWLIST TABLE IN tests/assertion-hygiene.bats IS THE LIST. One row per
# `file:pattern`, each stating the inversion applied, the colour observed and
# every residual left open; and two census cases there keep the table and the
# suite in step in both directions, so a pattern cannot exist unreviewed and a
# row cannot outlive its pattern: every window pattern in tests/ carries an
# allowlist row, and no row names a pattern tests/ no longer contains. Read it
# by verdict rather than from a sentence here — BOUNDED TO THE TABLE, because
# that file's planted fixtures write rows of their own and a whole-file grep is
# answered by them:
#
#   sed -n '/^allowlist_table() {/,/^ROWS$/p' tests/assertion-hygiene.bats \
#     | command grep '^VERDICT' | sort | uniq -c
#
# PINNED and ALLOWED are the two verdicts that say a site is sound;
# DIRECTION-BLIND says the site was checked and failed, and names the repair
# still owed. The command is written here rather than a row count, because the
# count changes as rows are added.
#
# WHAT THE CENSUS CANNOT SEE, so that a green one is not read for more than it
# says. It recognises the window shape `A[^.]{0,N}B` and nothing else. Tighten
# a pattern out of that shape — as several pins in this file did, trading the
# window for an adjacency bound — and it leaves the census with it, so no row
# can hold its measurement; that evidence lives in the case's own comment and
# nowhere else. And the census checks that a row EXISTS, never that its
# sentence is TRUE: whether a pattern really survives an inversion depends on
# the prose it reads, which no machine here judges.
#
# A pattern naming only a file or a field (`audit-report.yaml`, `verdict`)
# makes no directional claim and so has no polarity to pin — the first
# paragraph governs those. `measurement` IS NOT IN THAT LIST: the rule states
# its own direction in words the pattern can hold (`for measurement only`),
# pinning them Reds on `Bash is not limited to measurement`, and the bare topic
# word stays green through the same inversion. That pin and its negation guard
# stand in `tech-reviewer's Bash is measurement-only and never mutates`. A word
# is a topic only until somebody checks it, so that class is a finding and
# never a guess.
#
# WHAT IN THIS HEADER IS UNDER TEST, AND WHAT IS NOT — the distinction matters
# more than either half, because a partial guard described as none misleads
# exactly as much as none described as a guard.
#
#   ENFORCED, each by a named case in tests/assertion-hygiene.bats: the
#   negated-assertion rule; the window-pattern rule, in both directions (every
#   window pattern carries an allowlist row, and no row names a pattern tests/
#   no longer contains); the shape of a row (file, pattern, verdict and a
#   justifying sentence); and a guard over those four against silent removal,
#   which reds on a `skip` anywhere in that file and on any rostered case being
#   renamed away. Its limits are written into its own comment rather than left
#   here — a commented-out or gutted case is caught for the census case alone,
#   and no guard inside a file can outlive that file.
#
#   GUIDANCE, held by nothing but the next author reading it: behavior-level
#   over sentence-pinned, fixtures being the repo files themselves, a polarity
#   token inside the match rather than a shared negation helper, and every
#   verdict the allowlist records. Dropping one of these turns nothing Red.
#
# The grant-set cases are least-privilege pins: Write and Bash land on exactly
# the named agents, and Edit moves nowhere. The Edit case is a GREEN PIN —
# correct today, present so a grant that "comes along for the ride" reddens
# deliberately.

  #
  # THE PROSE CARRIES A TOKEN TO PIN. A rule worded `, before composing any
  # textual summary,` and pinned by `before[^.]{0,160}summar` makes `before`
  # the anchor AND the polarity at once, so a negation has nowhere to go but in
  # FRONT of it, where the window never looks: `never before composing any
  # textual summary` stays GREEN under a rule that says the opposite. No scope
  # and no count reaches that; only different prose does, so the rule reads
  # `never composing … first`.
  #
  # WHAT IS PINNED IS `never composing … first`, not the sentence. The negation
  # is ADJACENT to the verb it governs, so that mutation has no slot:
  # `never before composing` puts a word between the two and Reds, as does
  # dropping `never`, as does `first` -> `last`, as does deleting the clause
  # outright.
  #
  # THE ANCHORS ARE UNIQUE IN THE FILE: `compos` occurs exactly once here and
  # `first` exactly once, both inside this clause, so no neighbouring span can
  # answer for it. Named by content rather than by line, because line numbers
  # drift.
  #
  # `summar` IS DELIBERATELY NOT AN ANCHOR, and the leash is 60 characters. A
  # faithful rewording that renames the object (`never composing the prose
  # reply for the human first`) drops the word `summary` entirely and must stay
  # GREEN. What the leash proves is that the prohibition governs the composing,
  # and `composing` is this document's verb for the summary alone.
  # The `(^|[^A-Za-z])` guard is not decoration: `whenever composing` ends in
  # `never composing`. Nor is the ` +`: `flat` turns a newline into a space and
  # leaves any trailing one alone, so a reflow breaking between the two words
  # of the token hands the pattern TWO spaces and a single-space literal
  # false-Reds. Only whitespace can sit in that slot, so widening it admits no
  # reversal.
  #
  # THE RESIDUAL, named rather than left to be found: the rule restated in the
  # positive form — `before composing any textual summary` — false-Reds here.
  # That trade is taken knowingly: a claim whose polarity cannot be matched
  # without matching most of a sentence is stated in prose that carries a
  # polarity token, and the token is then required. A reader who wants the
  # positive form back has to keep the prohibition with it.

  # Fast/spike stories have no .draft/ until someone makes one, and THIS FILE
  # SAYS SO TWICE — the protocol step and the Rules bullet. `flat … | grep -q`
  # is answered by either span alone, so dropping the allowance from one site
  # would leave a bare `-q` GREEN. Counting the spans Reds every one-site
  # removal. The count SUBSUMES a `-q` — 2 spans implies at least one — so
  # keeping both would be a second assertion that cannot fail while the first
  # passes.
  #
  # COUNTED OVER FLATTENED TEXT, because the obvious `grep -c` is wrong twice
  # over: it counts matching LINES, so over `flat`'s single line it answers 1
  # however many spans exist, and over the raw file it answers 2 only while
  # both spans keep to a line of their own — a reflow that puts a newline
  # inside a span changes the raw count with not a word changed. Spans over
  # flattened text is the tolerance every other assertion in this file is
  # flattened for.
  #
  # EXACTLY TWO, AT A REAL COST: a legitimate THIRD statement of the allowance
  # false-Reds here. `-ge 2` Reds every removal just as well and buys that
  # third span silence; the exactness is taken deliberately, because
  # DUPLICATION is half of what makes a site like this blind, so a third span
  # belongs in front of a reader rather than under a green. It is the trade the
  # grant-set pins below take too — an addition as loud as a removal.
  #
  # WHAT THE COUNT DOES NOT GUARD: the DIRECTION. The permission reversed at
  # BOTH spans — `never creating .draft/ on demand` — keeps the count at two,
  # because the negation PREFIXES the anchor `creat`: no count and no scope
  # reaches it, only different prose does, and that prose is pinned in the
  # assertion below. The count stays because the two answer different
  # questions — this one whether the allowance is STATED at both sites, that
  # one in which DIRECTION — and neither subsumes the other: the both-spans
  # reversal keeps this count at 2 while Redding the pin, and either span
  # deleted outright Reds both.
  #
  # The count is captured before it is compared, not inlined into `[ "$(…)" ]`,
  # and that is the census talking rather than taste: the window-pattern walker
  # keys a row on the WHOLE quoted span, and inlining puts the pattern inside a
  # `"…"` that runs from `|` to `)`, keying a row nobody would recognise and
  # orphaning the one this pattern already has.

  # ...AND IN WHICH DIRECTION. A participle like `, creating `.draft/` on
  # demand.**` is reversed by `, never creating `.draft/` on demand.**` — a
  # negation in FRONT of the anchor, where no window looks. So the Rules bullet
  # uses the frame the protocol step uses, the shape `the run is failed` uses:
  # `is part of this step` SPLITS under `is NOT part of this step`. The bullet
  # reads `, and creating `.draft/` on demand is part of it.**`, and both agent
  # files carry the identical wording.
  #
  # ANCHORED AFTER `.draft`, NEVER BEFORE IT, which is arithmetic rather than
  # taste: `[^.]` cannot cross the full stop inside `` `.draft/` ``, so a
  # `creat…is part of` window could never reach the verb it needs. `is part of`
  # occurs exactly twice in this file, both inside the carve-out, so no
  # neighbouring sentence can answer for either span.
  #
  # COUNTED, for the reason the span count above is: a `-q` is answered by
  # whichever span survives. Reversed at both spans the count is 0, at either
  # span alone it is 1 — RED every time. Residual, named and accepted: a
  # rewording that drops the frame (`so this step creates `.draft/` itself
  # whenever it finds none`) false-Reds — the prose carries the token or the

  # state when the fix is trivial") Reds, but moving its OBJECT ("— never
  # refuse to mutate files or git state when the fix is trivial"), a rule that
  # licenses the mutation, stays GREEN.
  #
  # The negation sits on the mutation word, at most one `for` apart: `no-modif`
  # is excluded on purpose, because this paragraph names the rule as "The
  # no-modification rule" and that noun would answer the assertion by itself

  # the tool first is the co-location this case is named for — the grant

  # "**Do NOT modify files or git state. Only report.**" is a second span of
  # the prohibition and must not be able to stand in for this one.
  #
  # ONE `for` IS THE WHOLE WIDENING, and strict adjacency is too tight without
  # it: rewriting the half to "— never for mutation." preserves the rule
  # exactly and would false-Red. It keeps the sentence's own frame ("is for
  # measurement only") and negates it for mutation, so what is admitted is
  # that clause nominalised, not a gap: a VERB between the two is what
  # re-targets the negation, and "never refuse to mutate" is still RED.

  # back: a sentence where `carries` governs some OTHER noun while the pair
  # sits in a later clause can fall inside even a 40-character window. That
