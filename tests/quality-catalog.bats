# The quality catalog, the story legend, the Quality: field and the generated
# gates — the doc contract (story 024).
#
# The surface is agent-executed prose, so every case pins a BLOCK found by a
# structural anchor and asserts a keyword inside it, case-insensitively. No
# case requires a sentence verbatim: a correct rewrite must stay green.
#
#   C1  quality-catalog.md has the three tiers, the always tier names lint,
#       types and secrets, the context tier has a Signal column, and the file
#       says activating never installs a tool
#   C2  requirements.md carries the legend section in the template and the
#       guideline that sub-tasks cite it
#   C3  tasks.md documents the Quality field, the generated gates with their
#       command, rule 12 naming cross-reference.sh, and the Fast legend
#   C4  init-mode.md writes a Quality block and its Rules call it the default
#       legend
#   C5  constitution.md's template carries a Quality section
#   C6  analyst.md Function 1 reports the catalog's signals
#   C7  phase-gates.md loads the catalog with requirements.md and tasks.md
#   C8  validate-mode.md settles a generated gate by running its command
#   C9  plain-register.md renders the legend as the checks that were run
#
# Note on awk patterns: passed as strings, so no backslash escapes; literal
# punctuation goes in a bracket class.
