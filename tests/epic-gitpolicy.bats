# Story 007, Task 3.1 — scripts/epic-gitpolicy.sh contradiction lint.
# Contract (design §2, R4.1/R4.3): read-only script, run from the workspace
# root, emitting JSON:
#   {policy: tracked-md|local-only|undeclared, gitignore_ignores_epic: bool,
#    tracked_md: N, tracked_draft: N, verdict: consistent|contradiction|partial}
# Verdicts:
#   consistent    — reality matches the declared policy (or undeclared+untracked)
#   contradiction — tracked .epic files under an ignoring gitignore (kpranois),
#                   or tracked-md declared but gitignore blocks tracking
#   partial       — .draft/ files tracked, or subset tracking
# Non-git workspace: {git: false, verdict: "consistent"} and nothing else.
# Exit 0 always (except usage errors, 2). Uses real temp git repos — no
# mocked git state (fidelity: the lint's whole job is reading git reality).

# --- Appended at story 007, task 4.1 -----------------------------------------
# WHAT THE SIX CASES ABOVE LEAVE UNPINNED, AND WHY IT MATTERED. A tech review of
# task 3.1 found two contract gaps, and BOTH FIXES ADDED A JSON KEY AFTER THIS
# FILE WAS FROZEN — `gitignore_source` on the git path, `policy` on the non-git
# one. Nothing above holds either. Until the four cases below, deleting either
# key left `bats tests/` entirely green while two reference documents went on
# instructing agents to read it. That is orphan wiring, and an untested claim is
# what story 004 measured and rejected.
#
# 1. `gitignore_source` (R4.1) answers WHICH exclude file matched, which the
#    boolean beside it cannot. Git consults three sources and
#    `gitignore_ignores_epic: true` fires for any of them, but only the
#    workspace-root `.gitignore` is a file init may offer to edit:
#    references/init-mode.md gates its removal offer on
#    `gitignore_source == ".gitignore"`, reports `.git/info/exclude` as a file
#    local to the clone that it does not touch, and treats anything else as the
#    user's global core.excludesFile, which governs every repository on the
#    machine. references/list-mode.md prints the same field verbatim in its
#    notice. So the first two cases pin the two answers the boolean conflates,
#    and each is written to stay GREEN under the other's regression — a pair
#    that dies together pins one fact, not two.
#
# 2. The `null` case asserts the jq TYPE, and that is the whole case.
#    `jq -r .gitignore_source` prints the same four letters for a JSON null, for
#    the STRING "null" — a path named "null", which a consumer's `!= null` test
#    would miss, and precisely why the script emits the literal bare — and for a
#    key that is not in the document at all. Three different objects, one
#    identical line of output, so the obvious assertion cannot tell the contract
#    from two regressions. `| type` separates the string from the other two and
#    `has()` separates absent from present; both are asserted.
#
# 3. `policy` on the non-git object (R4.3) is the one key the two specs
#    disagreed about — the task ToDo said `{git: false, verdict: "consistent"}`
#    "and nothing else", design.md's error-handling note also sketched `policy`
#    — and the script resolved it in design.md's favour, because the declared
#    policy is read from a plain file that needs no repository and withholding
#    it would force init, whose defining workspace is a folder nobody has
#    `git init`-ed yet, to grow a second parser for `.epic/.gitpolicy`.
#    "Nothing else" still governs the four MEASUREMENT keys, which stay absent
#    because nobody measured them and because a consumer reading one there
#    aborts under `set -u`. That case therefore pins the exact key SET, not just
#    the one key.
#
# FIXTURE ISOLATION, and why only these cases carry it. A global
# core.excludesFile ignoring `.epic` — or an XDG `~/.config/git/ignore`, which
# git reads with no config entry at all, and which is where this machine keeps
# its global rules — turns the "nothing ignores it" case into `true` with the
# developer's own home directory as the source, on one machine and not another.
# Measured: with a hostile `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore` the identical fixture
# reports `gitignore_source: "/…/home/.config/git/ignore"`. `isolate_git_env`
# points every exclude source git can consult at a directory that DOES NOT
# EXIST:
#   HOME + XDG_CONFIG_HOME  the global config, and the ignore file git finds at
#                           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore or $HOME/.config/git/
#                           ignore even when core.excludesFile is unset
#   GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM     /etc/gitconfig, which may set core.excludesFile
#   GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR=       the init template, whose info/exclude is copied into
#                           every new repository
# GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL is the more obvious spelling and is deliberately NOT used:
# redirecting HOME and XDG_CONFIG_HOME already covers every global config path,
# while GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL would put a git >= 2.32 floor on this file for
# nothing. The directory is never created — git treats an absent HOME as an
# empty one, silently, measured — so the worktree under test stays pristine and
# the frozen `teardown` still reclaims everything under $WORK. The empty
# template is why the `.git/info/exclude` case creates that directory itself.

# --- Appended at story 007, sub-task 5.3 -------------------------------------
# THREE OF THE FIVE VERDICT ARMS WERE REACHABLE BY NOTHING. Every case above
# lands on arm 1 (kpranois: artifacts tracked under an ignoring rule), on arm 3
# (tracked .draft/) or on `consistent`. Arms 2, 4 and 5 shipped, and two
# reference documents instruct an agent to render a row for each of them, while
# no test in this repository could tell whether any of the three still fired.
#
# The chain's own comment says why that is worse than an ordinary coverage hole:
# reordering the arms "would keep every current test green and quietly downgrade
# the one verdict this script was written to produce". An ordered chain whose
# arms cannot be reached one at a time has an order that nothing enforces — the
# specification then lives in the comment alone, which is the state story 004
# measured and rejected.
#
# EACH CASE PINS AN ARM *AND* ITS NEIGHBOURS. Two arms answer `contradiction`
# and three answer `partial`, so the verdict string alone never says WHICH arm
# produced it: every case below also asserts the fields that separate it from
# the arm next door — `tracked_draft` (rules out arm 3), `policy` (rules out
# arms 4 and 5), `gitignore_ignores_epic` (rules out arms 1 and 2). "It returned
# partial" is not evidence about where it came from.
#
# All four characterize behaviour that ALREADY SHIPPED, so Red could not come
# from absent behaviour. Each was instead proved able to fail by mutating
# scripts/epic-gitpolicy.sh, watching that one case redden, and reverting —
# recorded in the story 007 red evidence as `red_via: mutation`.
#
# All four use init_isolated_repo, and not one of them could use init_repo:
# every one asserts `gitignore_ignores_epic` (three of them assert `false`), and
# a developer whose global core.excludesFile carries the old "never commit
# .epic" rule would flip that field — and with it the arm — on their machine and
